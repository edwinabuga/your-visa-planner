Applying for a UK Standard Visitor Visa from Kenya can feel overwhelming, but with the right preparation, you can put together a strong application. Here are the five most important things you need to get right.

## 1. A Valid Passport

Your passport must be valid for the entire duration of your planned stay in the UK. While there is no strict "six months validity" rule for UK visas like some other countries require, it is good practice to ensure your passport does not expire soon after your planned return date.

If your passport is damaged, has no blank pages, or is expiring soon, renew it before you apply.

## 2. Proof of Sufficient Funds

The UK authorities want to see that you can financially support yourself during your visit. This typically means providing:

- **Bank statements** for the last 3-6 months showing a healthy balance and regular income
- **Payslips** or employment letters confirming your salary
- **Evidence of savings** if you are self-employed or retired

The key is showing a consistent financial pattern, not just a lump sum deposited recently. Immigration officers are trained to spot sudden large deposits.

## 3. Evidence of Ties to Kenya

One of the most common reasons for visa refusal is failure to demonstrate strong ties to your home country. The UK authorities need to believe you will return after your visit. Strong ties include:

- **Employment:** A letter from your employer confirming your role, salary, and approved leave
- **Property:** Evidence of property ownership or a rental agreement
- **Family:** Evidence of dependants who remain in Kenya
- **Business:** Business registration documents if you are self-employed

## 4. A Clear Purpose for Your Visit

Your application should clearly explain why you want to visit the UK. Whether it is tourism, visiting family, attending a business meeting, or medical treatment, be specific and provide supporting evidence.

If visiting family, include an **invitation letter** from your host in the UK along with proof of their immigration status. If attending a business event, include the conference details or meeting invitation.

## 5. Travel and Accommodation Details

Show that you have a plan for your visit:

- **Flight itinerary:** A tentative booking or itinerary (you do not need to purchase tickets before your visa is approved)
- **Accommodation:** Hotel bookings, or a letter from your host confirming you will stay with them
- **Travel insurance:** While not mandatory, it demonstrates responsible planning

## Bonus Tip: Presentation Matters

Organise your documents neatly and in a logical order. A well-prepared application shows the decision-maker that you are organised and serious about your visit. Consider including a cover letter that summarises your application and ties everything together.
